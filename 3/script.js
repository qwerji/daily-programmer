// Challenge:
// create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. 
// The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc.").
// for extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, 
// or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces. These will be tested rigorously!

// Notes:
// My plan is to create a sort of "pseudo-console" in the browser, and create
// a system of input and outputs for the game. I could just use the JavaScript console,
// but thats not as fun...

// Commands to take care of:
//     look (up,down,left,right)
//     go (n,s,e,w)
//     inspect (thing)
//     get (thing)

// Story Idea:
// 1. You are trapped in a dungeon, chained to a wall.
//     Options: 
//         look (explains what is seen in the cell),
//         go (does nothing, you're chained to the wall),
//         get:
//             food - eat food
//             mouse - runs away
//         inspect:
//             chain - weak link -> lets you out of bonds
//             mouse - ...
//             food - ...
// 2. Let out of chains
//     Options:
//         look (same)
//         go:
//             n - to door
//             s - wall is behind you
//             e - nothing
//             w - window
// 3. Window
//     Options:
//         inspect window - ...
//         look w - same as inspect window
// 4. Door
//     Options:
//         inspect:
//             door - ...
//         
// This is a pretty lame game, but its more of a proof-of-concept.
// Addendum - I'm just going to use inspect for looking, it's much 
// more convenient than getting both of them to work.
// Second Addendum - This is taking way to long so I am removing the window location
